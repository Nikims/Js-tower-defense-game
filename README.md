# Js-tower-defense-game
A js tower defense game with canvas
This is our entrance to a group project assignment in which teams of 5-7 people can make any programming project of choice. Our team consists of Nikola Yordanov(me), Cvetan Petkov, Yavor Djapanov, Grigor Grigorov, Martin Uzunov, Kristian Penev and Dimitur Dukov. 

To run the game, just clone this repo and run the mainMenu.html file
There is no game engine involved in this project. Everything is made in pure written JS by me,debugged by ceco, including the particle all mechanics and visual effects.

Keep in mind that this repo is constantly being updated, and might have unstable versions
